# The Task: Algorithm Design

The focus of this project was to explain the process of creating algorithms and use this process to create simple algorithms.

- I have written my process [here](APPROACH.md).
- This is a simple programme to return the highest number in an array

---

## Setup 

Run the following in your computer's terminal:
```
- git clone git@github.com:fetc90/algorithm_design.git
- cd algorithm_design
- bundle install
```
## Testing 

```
rspec 
    => 5 examples, 0 failures
    => Coverage: 100% 
```
## Programme 

```
- IRB
- require './lib/algorithm_design.rb'
- > list = <enter array of integers>
- > highest_number_in_list(list)
  => <highest integer>
```
